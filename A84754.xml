            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The fir≈øt Damnable and Helli≈øh Plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt this Kingdome.</head>
            <p>IN the City of <hi>Norrige</hi> there was a great Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore, which awakened the Citizens of that place, and warned them to ≈øhake of their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and with all care and diligence to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the in≈øuing danger, now imminent over their heads, and ready to fall upon them.</p>
            <p>This Vprore was occa≈øioned by ≈øome in≈øolent, di≈øquiet, and ill intended Papi≈øts, who had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a mi≈øchief in their hearts, and were not at peace untill they had executed and given birth unto their mi≈øchievous de≈øign.</p>
            <p>They had their Agents for this Attempt, and the mercile≈ø≈øe fire mu≈øt be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in≈øtrument, by which they intend to perfect their de≈øires, They had hired two mercenary Knaves, by who≈øe hands they would bring their wi≈øhes to an end, which being placed at both ends of the City, at an oppointed time ≈øhould give fire to the Hou≈øes, the one was di≈øcovered, being about to ≈øet fire to a thatcht hou≈øe, and no harm was there acted, the other hadgiven fire to a hou≈øe joyning to the high Bridge-≈øtreet, which hou≈øe for want of pre≈øent a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance was burnt down to the ground, but by the providence and mercy of God, there the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb facs="tcp:156666:3"/> was ≈øtaid, and proceeded no further, which cau≈øed the Citi≈øens to keep a ≈øtrong Watch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øince, to prevent the like Attempts, if in Ca≈øe any ≈øhould be ≈øet on foot.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond, was a generall in≈øurrection of the Papi≈øts in Che≈øhire, occa≈øioned by an Order i≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from the High Court of Parliament, to this effect, That all Papi≈øts within his Maje≈øties Kingdome of England, ≈øhould be Di≈øarmed, and all Military Ammunition be taken from them.</p>
            <p>The chief Officers in that County endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to put this in execution, but they found very ≈øtout and re≈øolute Oppo≈øers, who denyed to part with any of their Arms, re≈øolving rather to part with their Lives then their Arms and weapons. The Major having this bold and audacious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer returned, commanded the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Train Bands to ≈øearch with him, who with their Muskets charged, with powder and bullets, did proceed in the Execution of the Majors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and were re≈øolved, where they found any uncivill oppo≈øition, to ≈øhoot down their Hou≈øes over their heads.</p>
            <p>The Papi≈øts having intelligence of thir Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, gathered together, and in the dead of the night began to ≈øet upon the City, and beat down the walls, the watch although not able to re≈øi≈øt, yet by their Clamor of Trea≈øon, pre≈øently awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the Citi≈øens, which cau≈øed the Rebels to fly unto my Lord Thooms his hou≈øe, but before they could reach ≈øo far, two of them were taken, the
<pb facs="tcp:156666:3"/> re≈øt by the Porters jealou≈øie, and the guard about the hou≈øe were ≈øu≈øpected to be of the Train band, and by that means were denyed Admittance, who by the pur≈øuit of the Train Band were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to pri≈øon.</p>
            <p>VVho no ≈øooner were laid fa≈øt, but the whole Train Band de≈øired Admittance unto the Lords hou≈øe which was denyed them; wherupon ≈øome af the Train Band Di≈øcharged upon the Hou≈øe, and beat down part therof, at which the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affrighted, made an E≈øcape, the Train Band entred the Hou≈øe, and ≈øearched it, but could not proceed without ≈øome le≈ø≈øe, for 15. of them were ≈ølain by the Papi≈øts who were in the Hou≈øe ready provided with Muskets and Bullets.</p>
            <p>The Ring-leader Starky him≈øelf was wounded, and by rea≈øon that he was not able to fly with the re≈øt, hee was apprehended and committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, who being now ready to dye, confe≈ø≈øed that they were encouraged to this Attempt, by the Lord Thoomes, and that their intent was to have ruin'd mo≈øt part of the Citie, and to have ≈ølain all the Paote≈øtants that they could reach, more hee confe≈ø≈øed not, but with the extremity of pain, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned by his wounds he pre≈øently died.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:156666:4"/>
            <p> The 3. was a generall in≈øurrection of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts in divers places of this Kingdome, which one M. <hi>Beal</hi> over-hearing the Di≈øcour≈øe of two of the Con≈øpirators, as hee was walking in the field, made di≈øcovery therof.</p>
            <p>There were many Letters conveyed by many Papi≈øts by the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of one Father <hi>Andrews</hi> to many places of this Kingdome. Letters were di≈øpatched into <hi>Buckiupham ≈øhire, Warwick ≈øhire,</hi> &amp;c. who when the fir≈øt blow ≈øhould have bin gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto many worthym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mbers of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. that then the re≈øt of their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in the Country ≈øhould be≈øtir them≈øelves and play their parts al≈øo.</p>
            <p>Notice of this was given to <hi>Alderman Soams,</hi> by M. <hi>Beal,</hi> by him to M. <hi>Pim.</hi> and the re≈øt of the Hou≈øe, and by this means their bloudy procedings prevented.</p>
            <p>The 4. and la≈øt, which at this pre≈øent I ≈øhall relate, was a <hi>Con≈øpiracy</hi> to free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Walle, alias Walker, alias Ward, alias Slater,</hi> from the ≈øentence of death, which was immediatly noi≈øed among the tribe of the <hi>Romi≈øh Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 15. of that month, being <hi>July,</hi> a great Number gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves together to <hi>Cur≈øtors Alley in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery Lane,</hi> where this Prie≈øt formerly
<pb facs="tcp:156666:4"/> lodged, where they held a long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Coun≈øell, how they might debar him out of the Hands of the Law and Ju≈øtice, one of the Crew was re≈øolved to go to <hi>New-Gate,</hi> and in Piety to ≈øo holy a Cau≈øe, would change Apparell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him with the lo≈ø≈øe of his own Life, <hi>thinking by this means to merit the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall memorie of a Romi≈øh Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having procured moneys of the re≈øt of the Brethren, and now being gone to wards <hi>New-Gate,</hi> more pious thought concerning his own wellfare came into his mind, and diverted him from that Re≈øolution, and having gotten a Salve for his Poverty, his Re≈øolution wa changed, and he re≈øolved to let <hi>Fathe Waller</hi> undergo his puni≈øhment him ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>He was re≈øolved now for <hi>Rome,</hi> and meeting one <hi>Hodgskins</hi> a Porter, he ≈øent back his mind in a Letter to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions by that Porter, but the Letter having no ≈øuper≈øcription, and the Porter
<pb facs="tcp:156666:5"/> being but of a rea≈øonable memory, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the parties Name to whom it was to be delivered.</p>
            <p>Wherupon he opened the Letter, and having read the <hi>Contents,</hi> came to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, found the Nea≈øt, but the Birds were flown, wherupon hee di≈øcovered all the Newes to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good worth, and by this means their Plot was prevented, and Father <hi>Waller</hi> hanged.</p>
